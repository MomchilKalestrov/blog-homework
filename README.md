This is a Next.JS project.

If the person reading this is Alex Kiosev:

I know I was supposed to just add comment functionality to the
project you shared, but I despise C# and it's framework, ASP.NET,
so much that I would rather rewrite the WHOLE project in a
TypeScript framework, which is obviously the far-superiour choice.

# How to Run

`npm run dev`
